Bosses should be able to do more interesting interactions with players than they can do to each other initially.

Bosses will have all the cool techniques to make it hard for players to win... special trainers like King Kai and people will be able
to teach special moves later on.. but they can be killed so that other players can't learn techniques.

1. Back Breaker + Throw to Ground
2. NegaForce
3. Slicer Disks
4. Regeneration
5. Ki Foam -> a barrage of ki blasts that stick to the player and weigh him down, collecting a mass of balls until the boss throws a big 
   trigger blast that detonates the entire group of balls. [Gohan attacks 2nd Form Frieza - https://youtu.be/C63FAU5JKyE]
   
6. *discovered during a bug in code* Rested Super Power -> charge up current ki out of total ki. However, instead of using it, 
continue to rest up total ki with regen. Then add the extra regen energy to current ki to surpass 100%
