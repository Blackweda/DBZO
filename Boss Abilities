Bosses should be able to do more interesting interactions with players than they can do to each other initially.

Bosses will have all the cool techniques to make it hard for players to win... special trainers like King Kai and people will be able
to teach special moves later on.. but they can be killed so that other players can't learn techniques.

Right Arm
Left Arm
Right Leg
Left Leg

Players can have:

Right Arm

  Instead of pulling total ki into defense ki, bosses and trained players can push all ki to defense ki and draw out for current ki in 
  attacks.
