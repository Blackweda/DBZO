As explained in previous files, Total Ki is a representation of how much latent power a fighter has. That power can be utilized in melee 
attacks, attack ball volleys, attack beams (like Kamehameha) or any other form of offensive attack. More important than these usages for
ki is the absolute need to have a reserve of the Total Ki that is designated ONLY for defense. 

The fact that a fighter has, for example, 1 million in Total Ki potential, does not mean that they will survive an attack ball of 500,000
ki, if they are not powered up. Ki needs to be utilized in two ways: in attack form, which uses ki against an enemy, and defense form, 
which protects one's own body from the opponents attacks as well.

The defense ki amount is subjective to the preference of individual fighters, however, it is recommeneded that at least 10% of Total Ki 
is stationed only for defense Ki. Here is an example in practical use.

A fighter has 1 million Total Ki.

They utilize 10% for defense Ki, or 100,000.

Let's say during a battle, both fighters are using an attack beam.
The battle Power of those attack beams are 10,000 per second, and the CUrrent Ki of our fighter is 50,000 while the other fighter has 
100,000 CUrrent Ki.

After 5 seconds, our fighter will become exhausted and no longer able to keep up his attack beam. This means that he is now receiving 10,000
ki per second directly. Since he is not resisting the attack with his own attack, the beam is directly hitting his body. He needs a buffer
of defense Ki to protect his body. Since his defense Ki is 100,000, he will use up half of that protection. This will diminish 50,000 from
his defense ki store, and to replace it again will cost him 50,000 out of his Total Ki, but he WILL STILL BE ALIVE. If his Current Ki had
run out, and his defense Ki had run out, the oppenents attack beam would have obliterated his body and severely wounded him or killed him.

That is why Defense Ki is super important. It is separate from Current Ki, therefore, every fighter will never use 100% of their Total Ki
during a battle for Attacks. They should always keep some Ki on reserve specifically for defense against Ki attacks to the body.
