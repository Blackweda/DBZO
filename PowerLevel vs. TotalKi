Difference Between Power Level and Total Ki
===========================================


In Dragonball Z, fighters can manipulate their power levels, which is essentially controlling how much output they are using.
This is not saying that they are getting stronger, but rather unleashing the full power they already possess. Alternatively, 
powering down means that they are using less power, and are more vulnerable, but not weaker instrinsically.


An Explanation By Example:

During the Majin Buu saga, we know that Goku has the ability to turn Super Saiyan 3. This means, when he powers up to SSJ3, 
he is at max potential. His attacks, defense are at max and every hit is incredibly strong. However, when he powers down to base
form, he cannot use attacks at SSJ3 level, but that doesn't mean the power doesn't still reside inside him. He just can't use it 
until he opens up his body by powering up. This also means, that while in SSJ3 form he can withstand a punch from Majin Buu,
if he was in base form, the punch would kill him, even though he had power within him to withstand it while powered up.

This creates the distinct difference between Power Level and Total Ki.

Total Ki is the amount of raw power that always resides within the fighter, his true potential. Power Level represents how much
of the power he is able to access currently. Imagine a water pump... the reservoir of water is the Total Ki, but the pipeline and 
the pressure of water coming out is the Power Level.

In representing these values, Total Ki is very much like mana, and can be represented simply as a large number that diminishes
over time through using it up. Power Level is represented as Ki usage/ second (DPS).


Total KI
    586,000 / 1,000,000
    
 
 
 Power Level
    4.85
    
    The working concept for representing power level is using a base of 10 for the BASE number and then a percentage for the SPREAD
    number.
    
    10^0 = 0 (how many zeroes)          ->      0 - 9
    10^1 = 1                            ->      10 - 99
    10^2 = 2                            ->      100 - 999
    10^3 = 3                            ->      1,000 - 9,999
    10^4 = 4                            ->      10,000 - 99,999
    
    Therefore, 4.86 means that the base power level or output is between 10,000 and 99,999 Ki/sec.
    The .86 means 86% of the range between 10000 and 99999.
    
    Calculation:
    
    99,999 - 10,000 = 89,999
    
    89,999 * 0.85 = 76,499  (76,500)
    
    10,000 + 76,500 = 86,500 -> Actual DPS
    
    CHECK MATH:
    
    89,999 * 0.80 = 72,000
    89,999 * 0.90 = 81,000
    
    81 - 72 = 9,000
    9,000 / 2 = 4,500
    
    81,000 - 4,500 = 76,500
    72,000 + 4,500 = 76,500

    Racial Training
    ===============
    
    We will start out with 3 races: Namekians - Saiyans - Herans
    
    The races will have different training styles and racial advantages as explained:
    
    During the anime show, we have consistently seen that Piccolo always keeps within reach of the Saiyans (in their base form). 
    Even when they surpass him in order to defeat a major boss, he catches up to that same power level within a few years time.
    
    Interesting to note that Saiyans receive Zenkai boosts fairly often, so that would give them a significant jump in power. So I
    believe for the game we can safely assume that Namekians can grow their base power level just as fast as Saiyans or perhaps even
    faster (PIccolo is actually younger than GOku as well).

    For the game we will make Namekians KI-Centric.
    
    This means that Namekians have the greatest edge when it comes to growing their base ki pool (since they don't have transformations).
    
    We will use Saiyans as the intermediary racial group, therefore if the ki regeneration rate and ki growth rate of Saiyans was 1:1,
    we could probably give Namekians a 1:1.3 or 30% greater efficency.

    In practice, this means that if both a Saiyan and Namekian had 100,000 ki pool, once a battle is done, a Saiyan might receive a growth 
    of 2,000 ki (about 2%), which would leave them at 102,000 total ki after a long day of training. The Namekian doing the same training 
    have gained approximately 2,600 ki (2.6%) ki after the training. We would give this boost to ki training so that while a Namekian will
    still be left behind when the Saiyans and Herans discover their transformations, in terms of base power, the Namekian can still hold 
    his own. Without a transformation, the growth rate of the Namkian will be left behind initially in the gameplay until they can access
    special abilities taught by grandmasters (such as Kaio-Ken boosts or God form). Keep in mind that often these special attacks and 
    techniques are derived from the base power foremost. This edge will keep the Namekian in the game and relevant.
    
    The Saiyans will have an intermediate relationship between Ki-centric and PowerLevel-centric training. What this means is that while a
    character can have massive amounts of ki pool, the power level they can rise up to (ki per second output) will be dependent on how 
    much training they have. In other words, we don't want a character with 1 million ki to power up all his ki into one massive attack 
    that does 1M damage. That would be unrealistic to the actual fighting strategy of the show and make the game boring. Rather it would be 
    prefereable that a character with 1 million ki can only raise his power level to 35,000 ki per second damage. This would mean that all
    his attack balls and attack beams have 35,000 ki per ball or per second. In terms of a Kamehameha battle, a 35k/sec attack could last 
    for roughly 28 seconds. This causes more room for changing strategy and also more anticipation because who knows who will run out of 
    juice first??
