Difference Between Power Level and Total Ki
===========================================


In Dragonball Z, fighters can manipulate their power levels, which is essentially controlling how much output they are using.
This is not saying that they are getting stronger, but rather unleashing the full power they already possess. Alternatively, 
powering down means that they are using less power, and are more vulnerable, but not weaker instrinsically.


An Explanation By Example:

Anytime a fighter is powered up to maximum, they can throw extremely hard hits and also receive hard hits too. However, when they 
power down, receiving that same blow would kill them. This does not mean that they no longer have the power inside them, but they
are not utilizing it for defense and offensive purposes. It's similar to flexing your muscles. If you try to lift up a heavy
piece of substance without flexing, you can't do it, however the power is still there if you were to actually exert yourself.

This creates the distinct difference between Power Level and Total Ki.

Total Ki is the amount of raw power that always resides within the fighter, his true potential. Power Level represents how much
of the power he is able to access currently. Imagine a water pump... the reservoir of water is the Total Ki, but the pipeline and 
the pressure of water coming out is the Power Level.

In representing these values, Total Ki is very much like mana, and can be represented simply as a large number that diminishes
over time through using it up. Power Level is represented as Ki usage/second (similar to Damage-Per-Second), but in this case
it would be called KPS. Its the equivalent to levelling-games, where every level is a new power level and we can allow our 
fighters to go up and down in level freely. However, the speed at which we power up will cause a drain of ki, so powering up 
slowly conserves more excess energy than a burst. This will be important for managing power in long fights.


Total KI:
    586,000 / 1,000,000 
    
Power Level Representation:
    5.651
    
    The working concept for representing power level is using a base of 10 for the BASE number and then a percentage for the SPREAD
    number.
    
    10^0 = 0 (how many zeroes)          ->      0 - 9 KI
    10^1 = 1                            ->      10 - 99
    10^2 = 2                            ->      100 - 999
    10^3 = 3                            ->      1,000 - 9,999
    10^4 = 4                            ->      10,000 - 99,999
    10^5 = 5                            ->      100,000 - 999,999 KI
    
    Therefore, 5.651 means that the base power level or output (5) is between 100,000 and 999,999 Ki/sec.
    The .651 means 65.1% of the range between 100,000 and 999,999.
    
    Calculation:
    
    999,999 - 100,000 = 899,999
    
    899,999 * 0.651 = 585,899  (round that to 585,900 roughly)
