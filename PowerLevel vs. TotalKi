Difference Between Power Level and Total Ki
===========================================


In Dragonball Z, fighters can manipulate their power levels, which is essentially controlling how much output they are using.
This is not saying that they are getting stronger, but rather unleashing the full power they already possess. Alternatively, 
powering down means that they are using less power, and are more vulnerable, but not weaker instrinsically.


An Explanation By Example:

During the Majin Buu saga, we know that Goku has the ability to turn Super Saiyan 3. This means, when he powers up to SSJ3, 
he is at max potential. His attacks, defense are at max and every hit is incredibly strong. However, when he powers down to base
form, he cannot use attacks at SSJ3 level, but that doesn't mean the power doesn't still reside inside him. He just can't use it 
until he opens up his body by powering up. This also means, that while in SSJ3 form he can withstand a punch from Majin Buu,
if he was in base form, the punch would kill him, even though he had power within him to withstand it while powered up.

This creates the distinct difference between Power Level and Total Ki.

Total Ki is the amount of raw power that always resides within the fighter, his true potential. Power Level represents how much
of the power he is able to access currently. Imagine a water pump... the reservoir of water is the Total Ki, but the pipeline and 
the pressure of water coming out is the Power Level.

In representing these values, Total Ki is very much like mana, and can be represented simply as a large number that diminishes
over time through using it up. Power Level is represented as Ki usage/ second (DPS).


Total KI
    586,000 / 1,000,000
    
 
 
 Power Level
    4.86
    
    The working concept for representing power level is using a base of 10 for the BASE number and then a percentage for the SPREAD
    number.
    
    10^0 = 0 (how many zeroes)          ->      0 - 9
    10^1 = 1                            ->      10 - 99
    10^2 = 2                            ->      100 - 999
    10^3 = 3                            ->      1000 - 9999
    10^4 = 4                            ->      10000 - 99999
    
    Therefore, 4.86 means that the base power level or output is between 10,000 and 99,999 Ki/sec.
    The .86 means 86% of the range between 10000 and 99999.
    
    Calculation:
    
    99,999 - 10,000 = 89,999
    
    89,999 * 0.86 = 76,499  (76,500)
    
    10,000 + 76,500 = 86,500
    
    CHECK MATH:
    
    89999 * 0.80 = 72,000
    89999 * 0.90 = 81,000
    
    81 - 72 = 9000
    9000 / 2 = 4500
    
    81,000 - 4500 = 76500
    72,000 + 4500 = 76500
