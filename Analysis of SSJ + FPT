Here I hope to think through the concepts of super saiyan transformations and also Full Power transformations for the game.

I think that Full Power Transformation is relatively easy. Its a small multiplier boost.
I think that FPT should have no energy loss like SSJ, but at the same time there is no energy regeneration while in the form.


Super Saiyan is more complicated because of misinformation.

At the time of Goku's first transformation, it is known that his power was about 50x his base power.
However, Akira Toriyama never stated that SSJ is meant to be a replacement multiplier to Kaio-Ken.
Kaio-Ken as a multiplier severely strains the body (stamina) and is a technique. Its similar to turning on Adrenaline at will.

Super Saiyan is a rage-induced mutation of the Saiyan's body, like Hulking out. So for all intents and purposes, let's imagine that the SSJ 
transformation makes the Saiyan a different kind of Saiyan, almost a new creature that is 50x stronger than a regular Saiyan.
Another way to look at it, is remembering the Oosaru form (the great ape).

Imagine that the Saiyan normally has the body DNA of a man. The Oosaru has the body DNA of an ape. The Oosaru is naturally stronger because
it is a different animal altogether.

Therefore, let's now take into account what Akira Toriyama said about Super Saiyan grades like Ascended, Ultra, 2 and 3.
He said they are not different than the regular Super Saiyan, but they are extended forms of the original form.

So now we have a conclusion to make... does Super Saiyan 2 and 3 act as multipliers to the normal base form OR are they just using ki at 
a more efficient rate( speed and strength for 2) or incredible speed and strength for 3). THerefore, are they like Adrenaline rushes of 
the Super Saiyan form?

Most of the fandom believes that:

Super Saiyan 1 is 50x base power
Super Saiyan 2 is 100x base power (2x that of Super Saiyan)
Super Saiyan 3 is 400x base power (8x that of Super Saiyan)

I disagree. But I want to combine the multiplier idea of Kaio-ken with the new body of Super Saiyan.

Why not say, SSJ is always a 50x multiplier of base power.
Then, say that SSJ2 is using BP at 2x more capacity of SSJ. and SSJ3 is using BP at 8x more capacity than SSJ?

As an example:

Base Power = 10,000,000.

Under normal fandom thoughts:

SSJ        = 500,000,000
SSJ2       = 1,000,000,000
SSJ3       = 4,000,000,000      // Yea, 4 Billion!! crazy.


Under my thoughts:

SSJ        = 500,000,000              2,780,000 million ki per second Battle Power of the 500 million over 3 minutes  
SSJ2       =                          5,560,000 million ki per second Battle Power of the same 500 million    
SSJ3       =                         22,240,000 million ki per second Battle Power of the same 500 million 

Now we can see, the amount of power is the same, but the output potential is crazy higher. The SS2 is twice as strong as SSJ and SSJ3 is
10x stronger than SSJ. But the same 500,000,000 remains.

Therefore, we can make it so that getting higher grades of Super Saiyan also relies on more Stamina AND having a base form that is 
somewhat close to the output per second of the Super Saiyan grade.

For example, Trunks and Goten could turn SSJ in their childhood. This is similar to transforming into Oosaru, being a genetic mutation
and not based on actual base power.
However, they never reached SSJ2 on their own. 

So lets say that ...
