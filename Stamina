This is an explanation and a logical working out of how stamina will work in the game.

Stamina is the toughness of the body, or how much strain it can handle. Normal use of ki will not burden stamina too much, such as the 
Namekians, who have not been seen to use multipliers or transformations. Their exhibition of strength is solely what they have achieved.

For Saiyans and Namekians, their SSJ and FPT will cause greater strain on the body, resulting in the need for more stamina.
However, the FPT will be more practical for the Herans, whose bodies are more adjusted to using it, therefore small multipliers like 3x
won't have the same effect that using a Kaio-Ken x3 would have, because this is a natural multiplier being used. The Heran can train their
body to use Kaio-Ken multipliers alongside their FPT, which will lock in the benefits for an extended period of time!
