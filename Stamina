This is an explanation and a logical working out of how stamina will work in the game.

Stamina is the body's ability to handle the ki pressure on itself, or how much strain it can handle. 
Normal use of ki will not burden stamina too much, such as the Namekians, who have not been seen to use multipliers or transformations. 
Their exhibition of strength is solely what they have achieved, for the most part.

For Saiyans and Namekians, their SSJ and FPT will cause greater strain on the body, resulting in the need for more stamina.
However, the FPT will be more practical for the Herans, whose bodies are more adjusted to using it, therefore small multipliers like 3x
won't have the same effect that using a Kaio-Ken x3 would have, because this is a natural multiplier being used. The Heran can train their
body to use Kaio-Ken multipliers alongside their FPT, which will lock in the benefits for an extended period of time!

I think that there should be two elements at play here...

Body Integrity and Stamina.

When the body is healthy and whole, body integrity should be at 100%.
When the stamina has not been taxed, it should match the base ki pool.

However, using multipliers or transformations will begin to decrease stamina over time, resulting in the ki pressure building up more and 
more as the body loses the ability to handle it. Users would need to get out of that transformtion, or result in serious injury/death. 
Another option is to train their bodies to acclimate to that strain and cause the decrease of stamina to slow down with practice.

Body integrity has to do with the actual body itself. Broken bones, lost limbs.. all decrease body integrity dramatically. Stamina strains
and injuries during battle also decrease body integrity.

KaioKen multipliers will give huge boosts in power at a cost: both body integrity AND stamina. By using up both, neither one or the other is
used up unnecessarily fast. Increasing the stamina during training will allow the KaioKen to be used longer... but the body integrity factor
is what controls the multiplier allowance.

Normally, stamina should match the Total Ki.

However, when transformations or power ups occur, the stamina normality initially matches the base normal ki. Therefore,
going SSJ would increase the stamina 50x to match the new power, but the stamina would drain much more quickly because the user
is not accustomed to it (STAMINA NORMALITY).
In the case of KaioKen x 10, for example, the stamina would still only match the normal base ki, so it would be at 10% of the ki
being used. The user must train their bodies to handle higher and higher degrees of stamina outbounds past their normal base ki
limits.
When Goku first learns KK, he goes as high as 4x against Vegeta. This put his body at 25% stamina normality, which affects his
body integrity pretty rapidly. As he trained longer periods on his way to Namek, his stamina grew to be able to handle x20 
eventually, because he had increased his ki and his training.

Note: KK multiplies the Current Ki being used. When total ki is siphoned into Current Ki, it is also multiplied. Base ki levels
don't change durin KK. Lowering the CK % will help during KK.
Example:

TKD is 100,000
CK @ 20% is 20,000
KK x 10 = 200,000
= 2x stamina normality

Lowering CK to 15%
kk X 10 = 150,000 / 100,000 
= 1.5x stamina normality
