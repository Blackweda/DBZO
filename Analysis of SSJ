Super Saiyan is complicated because of misinformation.

At the time of Goku's first transformation, it is known that his power was about 50x his base power.
However, Akira Toriyama never stated that SSJ is meant to be a replacement multiplier to Kaio-Ken.
Kaio-Ken as a multiplier severely strains the body (stamina) and is a technique. Its similar to turning on Adrenaline at will.

Super Saiyan is a rage-induced mutation of the Saiyan's body, like Hulking out. So for all intents and purposes, let's imagine that the 
SSJ transformation makes the Saiyan a different kind of Saiyan, almost a new creature that is 50x stronger than a regular Saiyan.
Another way to look at it, is remembering the Oosaru form (the great ape).

Imagine that the Saiyan normally has the body DNA of a man. The Oosaru has the body DNA of an ape. The Oosaru is naturally stronger 
because it is a different animal altogether.

Therefore, let's now take into account what Akira Toriyama said about Super Saiyan grades like Ascended, Ultra, 2 and 3.
He said they are not different than the regular Super Saiyan, but they are extended forms of the original form.

So now we have a conclusion to make... does Super Saiyan 2 and 3 act as multipliers to the normal base form OR are they just using ki at 
a more efficient rate(speed and strength optimized in SSJ2) or, 
incredible speed and strength at a huge cost for SSJ3). 
THerefore, are they like Adrenaline rushes of the Super Saiyan form?

Most of the fandom believes that:

Super Saiyan 1 is 50x base power
Super Saiyan 2 is 100x base power (2x that of Super Saiyan)
Super Saiyan 3 is 400x base power (8x that of Super Saiyan)

I disagree. But I want to combine the multiplier idea of Kaio-ken with the new body of Super Saiyan.

Why not say, SSJ is always a 50x multiplier of base power, since it is the original mutation transformation.
Then, say that SSJ2 is using Battle Power at 2x more capacity of SSJ. 
Nnd SSJ3 is using Battle Power at 8x more capacity than SSJ?

Thus SSJ is actually a natural 50x multiplier, but the subsequent forms are improvements on the SSJ form, not the base power.

As an example:

Base Power = 10,000,000.

Under normal fandom thoughts:

SSJ        = 500,000,000
SSJ2       = 1,000,000,000
SSJ3       = 4,000,000,000      // Yea, 4 Billion!! crazy. Pulling new power out of his ass?




Under my thoughts:

SSJ        = 500,000,000              2,780,000 million ki per second Battle Power of the 500 million over 3 minutes.  
SSJ2       =                          5,560,000 million ki per second Battle Power of the same 500 million.     
SSJ3       =                         22,240,000 million ki per second Battle Power of the same 500 million 

Now we can see, the amount of power is the same, but the output potential is crazy higher. The SS2 is twice as strong as SSJ and SSJ3 is
10x stronger than SSJ. But the same 500,000,000 remains.

Therefore, we can make it so that getting higher grades of Super Saiyan also relies on more Stamina AND having a base form that is 
somewhat close to the output per second of the Super Saiyan grade.

For example, Trunks and Goten could turn SSJ in their childhood. This is similar to transforming into Oosaru, being a genetic mutation
and not based on actual base power.
However, they never reached SSJ2 on their own, which requires an actual huge power behind it. 

So lets say that ...training in base form grows base form ki power. Training in super saiyan form grows stamina, which will
Later on allow greater bp usage. Because as a fact, we see that mastery of a grade eventually allows greater bp usage in that
Grade, using power seen by the higher grade. Also because saiyans grow stringer during battle. Vegeta and Trunks focused on shorter
Battles with more power. Goku and Gohan grew ki inside super saiyan form maybe by training longer inside it?
