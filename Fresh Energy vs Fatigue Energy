The fighter can train multiple times a day, with diminishing returns on gains.



Green Energy regenerates at 25% per hour (4 hours to get back 100% Green Energy)

Yellow Energy gives 50% gains of Green Energy

Yellow Energy regenerates at 10% per hour (10 hours to get back 100% Yellow Energy)

Yellow Energy left alone for 10 hours becomes Green Energy.

Therefore, the first hour of yellow energy (left alone) converts back to Green after 9 hours.
