Having Yellow Energy regenerate based on the hour also prevents players from spamming a boss. If everyone tired themselves out in 15 mins,
the boss would obliterate them all because his base total ki is so high.. Rather, one or two players should fight while th eothers wait,
and then by tag teaming, they can rest a bit and regain yellow energy.


The fighter can train multiple times a day, with diminishing returns on gains.

To prevent people maxing out PL all the time, anything over 65% PL starts to drain energy over time, shortening the fight.

100,000

The beginning of fight or training, fighter has 100% green energy.
Powered up to 100% PL,

20% Current Ki -> 20,000
BP is CK/3 mins = 110

After 3 mins, they have used 20,000 ki, but gained 7500 in yellow energy.

80% Green Energy,
13% Yellow Energy,
7% Empty

They refresh CK with another 20,000

Fight for another 3 mins

Green Energy 60%
Yellow Energy 26%
14% Nothing

Refresh

3 min fight

40% Green Energy
39% Yellow
21% NOthing

3 mins

20% G, 52% Yellow, 28% Nothing

3 mins

65% Yellow, 35% Nothing

3 mins

45% Yellow + 7.5 Yellow = 52.5 Yellow

3 mins

32.5 Yellow + 7.5 = 40% Yellow

3 mins

20% yellow + 7.5 = 27.5

3 mins

7.5 + 7.5 = 15

2 mins -> All energy exhausted, if below 10%, regenerated energy is RED energy.

Total time = about 29 minutes fight time, with another 2 mins of charging up time (if non-stop fighting / training.)

This equals 100% Green Energy Used and 95% Yellow Energy Used.
Returns are +1000 (green) and another +285 (yellow energy = 30% of green energy * 95% )






Green Energy regenerates at 10% per hour (10 hours to get back 100% Green Energy)                10,000 per hour
Yellow Energy regenerates at 2.5% per minute.                                                   2,500 per minute
Yellow Energy gives 30% gains of Green Energy
