Definitions of Character Stats
==============================


In Dragonball Z, fighters can manipulate their power levels, which is essentially controlling how much output they are using.
This is not saying that they are getting stronger, but rather unleashing the full power they already possess. Alternatively, 
powering down means that they are using less power, and are more vulnerable, but not weaker instrinsically.


An Explanation By Example:

Anytime a fighter is powered up to maximum, they can throw extremely hard hits and also receive hard hits too. However, when they 
power down, receiving that same blow would kill them. This does not mean that they no longer have the power inside them, but they
are not utilizing it for defense and offensive purposes. It's similar to flexing your muscles. If you try to lift up a heavy
piece of substance without flexing, you can't do it, however the power is still there if you were to actually exert yourself.

This creates the distinct difference between Power Level, Battle Power, Total Ki and Current Ki.

Total Ki is the amount of raw power that always resides within the fighter, his true potential. Power Level represents how much
of the power he is able to put on reserve and access currently. Imagine a water pump... the reservoir of water is the Total Ki, 
but the pipeline and the pressure of water coming out is the Power Level.

In representing these values, Total Ki is very much like mana, and can be represented simply as a large number that diminishes
over time through using it up. Power Level is represented as the potential or capacity of strength a fighter has charged up. Its the 
equivalent to levelling-games, where every level is a new power level and we can allow our fighters to go up and down in level freely. 
However, the speed at which we power up will cause a drain of ki, so powering up slowly conserves more excess energy than a burst. 
This will be important for managing power in long fights.

Once a fighter has stored up a reserve amount of energy (Current Ki), that energy will be consumed over time during a fight. 
The amount of damage per second that the fighter unleashes is their Battle Power. The usage of ki over time will consume the Current Ki 
that has already been put on reserve. 

The definitions on their own are confusing, so a set of examples will help demonstrate them --->

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Total Ki 
     [ The raw amount of ki a fighter innately possesses (similar to MANA bar in other games. ]:

    Frieza in his final form at 100% has a total capacity for 120 million Ki damage. Therefore, his total Ki prior to fight is:
    
    120,000,000 / 120,000,000


Power Level Representation
     [ A number that represents the percentage of Ki potential being used. The number is itself is not a percentage (like 50%), but
      represents the power of what the fighter's 50% potential is. ]:
      
    When Frieza is at 50% capacity, his Power Level is 60 million Ki damage. This means that if he were to put all his energy into one
    single punch or one single energy ball, the most power he could use up is 60 million, and you would see that he is exhausted. This
    would result even though we know he still has another 60 million left in his body. The power level represents the self-imposed cap 
    on energy usage.
    
    Frieza's power level at 50% could be represented in two ways:
    
    1)         60,000,000
    2)         7.67
    
    We can choose which option is more convenient to display, although using #1 might confuse us with Total Ki.
    
    
    The working concept for representing power levels in #2 is using a base of 10 for the BASE number and then a percentage for the 
    SPREAD number.
    
    10^0 = 0 (how many zeroes)          ->      0 - 9 KI
    10^1 = 1                            ->      10 - 99
    10^2 = 2                            ->      100 - 999
    10^3 = 3                            ->      1,000 - 9,999
    10^4 = 4                            ->      10,000 - 99,999
    10^5 = 5                            ->      100,000 - 999,999 
    10^6 = 6                            ->      1,000,000 - 9,999,999
    10^7 = 7                            ->      10,000,000 - 99,999,999
    10^8 = 8                            ->      100,000,000 - 999,999,999
    
    Therefore, 7.67 means that the base power level or output (7) is between 10,000,000 and 99,999,999 Ki.
    The .67 means 67% of the range between 10,000,000 and 99,999,999.
    
    Calculation:
    
    99,999,999 - 10,000,000 = 89,999,999
    
    89,999,999 * 0.67 = 60,299,999
    
    
    
    Battle Power and Current Ki
    [ When Frieza has powered up to 50% capacity, that doesn't mean that he punches 60 million damage every attack. This would 
    erroneously mean that he can only perform two attacks then he is wiped out of power. Every fighter paces themselves, and the 
    amount of damage that they perform per second is Battle Power. This is why you can see them have melee fights that last several
    minute before they have to stop and charge up their Current Ki]:
    
    
    For an estimation, let's assume that during any given point in a battle, a fighter will stop and charge up his energy every 3 - 5
    minutes. This is based on both concepts of Current Ki and Battle Power. 
    
    Often when a fighter is raising their power level, it has an effect on the environment. The ground begins to break up and shake, 
    the wind kicks up and a force seems to push back everything around the fighter. This is strictly a result of powering up, or 
    raising the Ki potential usage. This is Frieza powering up from 1% potential to 50% potential. Once Frieza has reached 50%, his 
    reserve of Current Ki is only a fraction of that 60 million potential. Let's say 20% or 12 million. If after a few minutes of fighting,
    he becomes exhausted, its because he has used up his Current Ki reserve. He will begin to refresh his store of Current Ki. The purple
    aura will become visible again, but the effects on the environment aren't present. This is because he is not raising the bar (which 
    results in a lot of volatile ki waste), but is simply refreshing his Current Ki with more latent power in his body.
    
    Now, the fact that Frieza can battle for a few minutes using only 12 million ki means that he is pacing himself over those few minutes.
    Let's say 3 minutes. This means that his Battle Power is his actual damage-per-second (DPS).
    
    3 minutes is 180 seconds:
    
    12,000,000 / 180 = 66,666 BP
    
    This implies that during his battle with Goku, every single punch is using 66,670 damage per second. Every single volley of ki attacks
    are using 66,670 ki. Yet when he charges an attack, he is taking time to put more power into a large attack ball, say 1,000,000 ki. This
    large attack ball is worth 14 seconds of DPS. Since his Current Ki at max holds about 12 million, he can only do a few of these large
    attacks combined with a couple of minutes of melee and quick volleys before he gets tired. Once he gets tired, he must charge up his
    Current Ki again, which diminishes another 12 million ki from his Total Ki (mana pool).
    
    
    Now, once again, the Power Level does not represent how much Ki a fighter can access. Frieza at 50% capacity does not mean that Frieza
    can only use 60 million ki and not the full 120 million during a fight. The Power Level is simply a way to represent how much potential
    the fighter is using, which helps to determine their Current Ki and Battle Power ratings.
    
    The Current Ki reserve is not limited to 20%. The Battle Power is not limited to Current Ki / 3 minutes. These values are determined by
    the fighter themselves, and the extent to which they can manipulate those values is a result of training and special skills. In reality,
    when Frieza is 50% capacity, he could charge up his Battle Power so that he can only attack for 1 minute before getting exhausted. He 
    could also at the same time raise his Current Ki reserve to 40% of his Power Level rating. Here is what that would look like:
    
    60,000,000 x 40% = 24,000,000 Current Ki Reserve
    
    24,000,000 / 1 minute = 400,000 Battle Power
    
    In this scenario, Frieza would most likely be using a bulking up technique, similar to Ultra Super Saiyan Trunks form. This technique
    would cause serious strength increases, but severely affect speed. But for the sake of the example, the fight would look like this:
    
    Every single punch from Frieza hits for 400,000 damage. Every volley hits for 400,000 damage. A bigger charged attack may hit for 5 
    million, which would take out 12.5 seconds worth of melee attack time. So Frieza could only fight for about 45 seconds of melee with one
    large attack, and then become exhausted. He would need to recharge his Current Ki and refresh another 24 million of ki taken from his 
    Total Ki. This means that his entire battle with Goku could only last at most about 5 minutes or less before COMPLETELY 
    exhausting his Total Ki. This strategy is POSSIBLE with training endurance (Current Ki % Potential) and also with learning the 
    Bulking Up technique (raise Battle Power to favor harder hits, with slower speed and less pacing), although it is very dangerous to 
    perform (lots of wasted energy and possibility of not being fast enough to hit the target).
    
    
    A typical strategy in Dragon Ball Z is to pace oneself in a fight against another opponent. The goal is to find a way to get the 
    opponent to use up most of their Current Ki reserve, and leave enough of your own Current Ki reserve so that before they can charge
    up more, you overpower their remaining Current Ki reserve AND their Defense Ki reserve, in order to kill them. An explanation of 
    Defense Ki follows...
    
    
    Defense Ki
    [ As explained in previous files, Total Ki is a representation of how much latent power a fighter has. That power can be utilized in melee 
attacks, attack ball volleys, attack beams (like Kamehameha) or any other form of offensive attack. More important than these usages for
ki is the absolute need to have a reserve of the Total Ki that is designated ONLY for defense. 

The fact that a fighter has, for example, 1 million in Total Ki potential, does not mean that they will survive an attack ball of 500,000
ki, if they are not powered up. Ki needs to be utilized in two ways: in attack form, which uses ki against an enemy, and defense form, 
which protects one's own body from the opponents attacks as well.

The defense ki amount is subjective to the preference of individual fighters, however, it is recommeneded that at least 10% of Total Ki 
is stationed only for defense Ki. Here is an example in practical use.

A fighter has 1 million Total Ki.

They utilize 10% for defense Ki, or 100,000.

Let's say during a battle, both fighters are using an attack beam.
The battle Power of those attack beams are 10,000 per second, and the CUrrent Ki of our fighter is 50,000 while the other fighter has 
100,000 CUrrent Ki.

After 5 seconds, our fighter will become exhausted and no longer able to keep up his attack beam. This means that he is now receiving 10,000
ki per second directly. Since he is not resisting the attack with his own attack, the beam is directly hitting his body. He needs a buffer
of defense Ki to protect his body. Since his defense Ki is 100,000, he will use up half of that protection. This will diminish 50,000 from
his defense ki store, and to replace it again will cost him 50,000 out of his Total Ki, but he WILL STILL BE ALIVE. If his Current Ki had
run out, and his defense Ki had run out, the oppenents attack beam would have obliterated his body and severely wounded him or killed him.

That is why Defense Ki is super important. It is separate from Current Ki, therefore, every fighter will never use 100% of their Total Ki
during a battle for Attacks. They should always keep some Ki on reserve specifically for defense against Ki attacks to the body.
