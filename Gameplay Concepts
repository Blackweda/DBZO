What was great about World of Warcraft?

The music compositions, the world to explore.

What should the future of gaming be?

Becoming, not collecting.

All players should gain skills like speed, strength, with certain abilities tied to their classes...
however, those skills can be IMPROVED by time and experience using them... not gaining armor pieces

every player should have the ability to fight as a dps or healer or tank based on how they have trained each aspect and can switch out their usuage

bosses do not focus on tanks but focus on everybody and continually adapt to the movements of the players. (AI)
