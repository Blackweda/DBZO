150 Years After Dragon Ball Z

Piccolo is middle-aged and stays on lookout with Dende and Mr. Popo.
Buu has gone into a deep hibernation sleep.

Vegeta became a god of destruction and lives with Whis, eating from the great tree to prolong his lifespan.
Beerus and his brother Champa visit from time to time, but mostly journey around the universes eating great food.

Piccolo has a power level of about 600 million. (Greater than Super Saiyan 2 or just about beginning of Super Saiyan 3 power)
------------------------------------------

A new threat comes to the North And West galaxies out of the South and East. The Southern Galaxy has their strongest race, the Herans,
coming to dominate the entire universe. Piccolo resurrects the Saiyan people to counter-attack the front lines. He teaches them the 
extent of the powers that the Saiyans reached and guides them in their training.

The saiyans make a pact of peace with the Namekians, who likewise learn from Piccolo the extent of the powers of their race as well.
King Vegeta leads his people on a settlement on New Namek, while Bardock is promoted to being an officer in the army; both learning of the
legacies of their sons. 

----------------------------------------------------------

The Herans had created a small colony of survivors hidden deep in the planet as its destuction was occurring from environmental reasons.
Surrounded by the crystals, they absorbed its radiation and have the ability to transform without its power source anymore. After being
in hibernation for 100 years, they began to repopulate the planet and train themselves to conquer other planets. They have allied with the
race of Frieza in the East galaxy, who had received news of the utter demise of Frieza in his attempt to control the North galaxy 
single-handedly. The Herans have gathered warriors from the different planets in the South and East galaxies, to conquer the North and West
for themselves.
