Hell's Armies
=============


After the Saiyan planet was destroyed, the deceased Saiyans went to Hell in the North Galaxy.
The Herans' destruction by Broly likewise sent them to Hell of the South Galaxy.

150 Years after the events of the Majin Buu saga, the Namekian home world faces a new threat.
The saiyan bloodlines on Earth have degenerated, with Pan and Bulla already dead (25% saiyans).
Dende, the guardian of Earth, sends Piccolo (middle-aged) to help on New Namek with the help of Supreme Kai.

Piccolo has seen much time of peace, and has a power level of about 600,000,000.

On arrival, he dispatches of the threat but learns that the East and West galaxies have allied to take over the entire universe.
He had managed to defeat the scouting party, of which he had much trouble.

Realizing that a war was coming, he decided to gather the Namekian dragon balls and wish for the restoration of Planet Vegeta's people.
Placed on New Namek with no way to leave the planet, Piccolo explains the situation. He tells them that long ago he fought with the greatest
Saiyans, Prince Vegeta and Kakarot, who went past the powers of legend. 

Inspired by the legacy, King Vegeta makes a pact with the Namekians to work together to defend the galaxy. Piccolo introduces the great-great
grandson of Vegeta, who has the family features. King Vegeta pronounces him new Prince Vegeta, forever allying the Saiyans to the protection
of Earth.

Saiyans first quests are on original Vegeta, where they witness their own destruction by Frieza.
They reappear on New Namek, and listen to Piccolo's tale. THey continue their training and fighting skimishes from that base.

Namekians can have up to 2 friends (NPC's) who they train with. They can choose to level up the group as a whole or eventually absorb them.
