BATTLE POWER CENTRIC

Saiyans getting stronger is ALWAYS a percentage/factor of the Resistance against the Opposing Force (gravity, attacks, etc).
Therefore, unlike Namekians, Saiyans don't get stronger by using up ki and growing back more of it.

They grow by the degree of force they are opposing (like weightlifting).


              ( Force / Second )
Ki Growth =   ------------------   x   Battle Power   -> Every 10 minutes of battle (Saiyans grow during fighting as well)
              ( Battle Power   )
               
               
              
Example:

Goku has gravity machine at 100x normal gravity.
In Unity3D, gravity is about 9.98 F / second.
At 100x, this number would be about 1000 / second.

During Goku's fight with Captain Ginyu, he showed a 
Power Level of about 180,000

So if we take about 100,000 as the real power level...
100,000 @ 100% -> Powered up all the way during training, full access to all Ki
100,000 / 3 mins -> average Battle Power setting
=  555 BP/sec.

so clearly that's not enough to handle the force of gravity and stand up.. so GOku 
would have to raise his battle power to match.
so if Goku doubled his BP, he could train for about 1.5 minutes before using up all his power.

So the equation would be:

         1,000 [force]
       ---------         = 0.9
         1,110 [BP]
         
Then take that number and multiply the BP used amount by it.

1,110 x 0.9 = 999

And now, the Total Ki is 100,999.


I think this makes sense, so that Saiyans can't use really high Battle Power and cheat...

Let's say gravity was still 1000 / second. But the saiyan was a lot stronger and used 3000 BP.

The formula is :

1000 divided by 3000 = 0.3333333....

THen we do: 3000 x 0.33333 = 1000

So the Total Ki is still roughly 101,000.... not much different.

In this way, the Saiyan will constantly need greater amounts of Force to fight against to actually get stronger. Just wasting Ki won't
help him at all.

However, during his training, if he trains for a long period of time, say every 7 minutes, there is an extra bonus of Ki growth. This 
is so that Saiyans can grow stronger while fighting and keep raising their BP.

On top of this training strategy will be Zenkai boosts.

Depending on how near death the Saiyan is, we can multiply the entire PL of the Saiyan by a percentage that is aded on top of the growth.

Let's say the Saiyan has a PL of 5.75:

A Zenkai boost may at 0.3 x 0.75 (spread) = 0.225 + 5.75 = 5.975

675,000   ->   873,000

That's a 198,000 ki increase!! That kinda makes sense for a Zenkai Boost. The highest Zenkai Boost may be around 0.6:

0.75 x 0.6 = 0.45 + 5.75 = 6.2

675,000   ->   1,800,000     

That is 1,125,000 ki growth!!! 


SIDE NOTE:

In order to prevent people from cheating (i.e. intentionally getting their friends to get them down to almost dying, and spam Zenkai
Boosts), the game will calculate every measurement of Ki down to 3 fractional digits. However, all Ki values in the game will be 
represented as whole numbers.

This means that a Kamehameha attack might have a BP of 3,450.675, but the gamer will only see 3,450. This will make it impossible to 
exactly gauge time limits and how much power is needed to get somebody to one inch of their life. A little bit of unpredictability is
good for the game!
