Saiyans getting stronger is ALWAYS a percentage/factor of the Resistance against the Opposing Force (gravity, attacks, etc).
Therefore, unlike Namekians, Saiyans don't get stronger by using up ki and growing back more of it.

They grow by the degree of force they are opposing (like weightlifting).


               Battle Power
Ki Growth =   ------------------------
               Force / Second
               
               
              
Example:

Goku has gravity machine at 100x normal gravity.
In Unity3D, gravity is about 9.98 F / second.
At 100x, this number would be about 1000 / second.
