Saiyans getting stronger is ALWAYS a percentage/factor of the Resistance against the Opposing Force (gravity, attacks, etc).
Therefore, unlike Namekians, Saiyans don't get stronger by using up ki and growing back more of it.

They grow by the degree of force they are opposing (like weightlifting).


              ( Force / Second )
Ki Growth =   ------------------   x   Battle Power   
              ( Battle Power   )
               
               
              
Example:

Goku has gravity machine at 100x normal gravity.
In Unity3D, gravity is about 9.98 F / second.
At 100x, this number would be about 1000 / second.

During Goku's fight with Captain Ginyu, he showed a 
Power Level of about 180,000

So if we take about 100,000 as the real power level...
100,000 @ 100% -> Powered up all the way during training, full access to all Ki
100,000 / 3 mins -> average Battle Power setting
=  555 BP/sec.

so clearly that's not enough to handle the force of gravity and stand up.. so GOku 
would have to raise his battle power to match.
so if Goku doubled his BP, he could train for about 1.5 minutes before using up all his power.

So the equation would be:

         1,000
       ---------         = 0.9
         1,110
         
Then take that number and multiply the BP used amount by it.

1,110 x 0.9 = 999

And now, the Total Ki is 100,999.


I think this makes sense, so that Saiyans can't use really high Battle Power and cheat...

Let's say gravity was still 1000 / second. But the saiyan was a lot stronger and used 3000 BP.

The formula is :

1000 divided by 3000 = 0.3333333....

THen we do: 3000 x 0.33333 = 1000

So the Total Ki is still roughly 101,000.... not much different.

In this way, the Saiyan will constantly need greater amounts of Force to fight against to actually get stronger. Just wasting Ki won't
help him at all.
