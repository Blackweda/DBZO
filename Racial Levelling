Namekians

[ The Namekian race does not have transformations like Super Saiyan or Full Power. However, I believe that the base form growth rate of 
  Namekians are on par or perhaps even greater than Saiyans. This assumption comes from the fact that Piccolo is younger than Goku and 
  Vegeta, and while Goku learned Kaio-Ken for Saiyan saga and Super Saiyan for Freiza saga, Piccolo was always able to grow in power enough 
  to beat those opponents a few years later, only in his base form. Piccolo was able to easily defeat Saibamen (Raditz power level) with 
  incredible ease after only one year of training (rather meditating while training Gohan actually). He did not train at 10x gravity on 
  King Kai planet like Goku, nor did he have a multiplier technique to use. During the Android saga, Piccolo could easily defeat the Dr.
  Gero and Android 19 after 3 extra years of training, which took Vegeta and Goku fighting in Super Saiyan to beat. This means that 
  Piccolo would have been able to defeat Frieza at this point, which means his base is at Goku Super Saiyan level (during Namek fight). 
  After a   certain point, Piccolo falls out of range of the Saiyans, only because their SSJ2 and SSJ3 power jumps are so huge, he can't 
  keep up in base form, although I'd argue that Piccolo fighting GOku or Vegeta in base form would be a different story! 
  
  With this analysis, I'm giving a favourable advantage to Namekians for growing their Ki pool, which raises their base form at a much faster
  rate than Saiyans or Herans.  ]

Total Ki Regen (during combat):

  15% untrained every 3 mins        -> Only 75% can be regen of total Ki every training session or fight. Afterwards fighter must stop.
  25% trained every 3 mins

Total Ki Regen (after combat):

  30% every 3 mins

Highest Power Level Threshold:

  70 - 77.5 % of Total Ki

Total Ki Growth Algorithm (Total Ki Centric):

  For every point of Ki expended during training or meditating, it grows back at 102%.
  This means that a Namekian can power up to 20% of their total Ki and spend hours meditating and pulsing energy.
  They can use Ki regen dynamics to increase their training. Also they will not experience battle fatigue or injury.
  
  Example:
  
  A Namekian has 1,000,000 Total Ki.
  20% PowerLevel puts thems at 200,000
  
  Melee Battle Power is 200,000 / 3 mins -> 1,111 Ki / Second (without Bulking charging)
  Attack Balls = 1,111 Per Ball (without charging time)
  Attack Beam = 1,111 Per Second (without charging time)
  
  This equates to a Namekian meditating and exerting 1,111 Ki per second for 1000 seconds (16 mins), including the Ki regen power,
  which is 15% of 1M (150,000), 5 times(max 75%) ( 5 x 150,000 = 750,000)... 750,000 /1,111, which is about another 11 minutes.
  So in 27 minutes, they have exerted all of their power. 
  
  They will regenerate in 9+ mins and have a base Ki pool of 1,020,000 (102%), but the rest period must be followed afterwards. 
  Consecutive training should be prohibited. Allow interval of [ 5 ] hours between training sessions. [ We never see Piccolo or any 
  Namekians sleeping! ]

Saiyan
[ The Saiyan race relies heavily on Transformations (Oozaru, SSJ forms) as well as their racial ability of Zenkai boosts. While the 
Namekian's strategy will be to consume their Ki in whatever fashion, as fast and as often as possible, the Saiyans will rely heavily
on receiving Zenkai boosts from near death battles or training that damages their body from 88% - 99%. This will happen if they receive 
attacks that overpower their battle power, wiping out their defensive ki, and directly hitting them without any ki defenses. The other
way that they grow is from actual battles or training that offers offers resistance against their own Ki. The best way to describe it 
would be to use the analogy of weightlifting.A Namekian could stand there and flex their muscles, and this alone would cause them to 
grow stronger. The saiyan would need to actually flex his muscles because he is lifting actual weight. The straining of his power 
causes growth. Theredfore a saiyan needs to be using his ji to attack, defend against attacks, or be resistigg the effects of 
gravity for example ( which is sort of liie pushing back against the ground - giving gravity a ki drain/second value that simulates 
holding back an attack beam)


***
Previous Version:
a combination of ( excessive Ki usage + Pushing their Power Level ), with Zenkai boosts as a exceptional increase to power with the 
risk of death. Saiyans cannot simply waste Ki like Namekians. They must exert power against an opposing force or pressure (such as 
another fighter, ki energy, or gravity).***

Heran
[ There is little information concerning how the transformation of Herans works or how they get stronger. Therefore we can this 
opportunity to play with creating a training regiment that fits on the other spectrum of Namekian's ki-centric training style. 
So we have a race that will be PowerLevel-centric. This means that Herans will have great adaptability with manipulating their 
Power Levels, and this will determine their ki growth.. for Herans, we will determinethat atheir Full Transformation is a simple 
3-5x multiplier of whatever Battle Power they are at. this means if they are in base form with a babattle power of 200,000 they do
1.111 damage/sec. With full power, their power level remains the same but the BP is at 600,000 now or 3,333/sec. The full power
will stack in top of any boosts. Kaioken will boost base power by 10x... But full power stacks on anything. A hran using 
kaioken x 10,will have 200,000 x 10 = 2,000,000 x 3 = 6,000,000 -> which translayes to 33,333 damage/sec.
