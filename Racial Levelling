Namekians

[ The Namekian race does not have transformations like Super Saiyan or Full Power. However, I believe that the base form growth rate of 
  Namekians are on par or perhaps even greater than Saiyans. This assumption comes from the fact that Piccolo is younger than Goku and 
  Vegeta, and while Goku learned Kaio-Ken for Saiyan saga and Super Saiyan for Freiza saga, Piccolo was always able to grow in power enough 
  to beat those opponents a few years later, only in his base form. Piccolo was able to easily defeat Saibamen (Raditz power level) with 
  incredible ease after only one year of training (rather meditating while training Gohan actually). He did not train at 10x gravity on 
  King Kai planet like Goku, nor did he have a multiplier technique to use. During the Android saga, Piccolo could easily defeat the Dr.
  Gero and Android 19 after 3 extra years of training, which took Vegeta and Goku fighting in Super Saiyan to beat. This means that 
  Piccolo would have been able to defeat Frieza at this point, which means his base is at Goku Super Saiyan level (during Namek fight). 
  After a   certain point, Piccolo falls out of range of the Saiyans, only because their SSJ2 and SSJ3 power jumps are so huge, he can't 
  keep up in base form, although I'd argue that Piccolo fighting GOku or Vegeta in base form would be a different story! ]
