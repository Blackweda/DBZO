Three Phases of Attack:

Attack based on current ki - so when reserve ki has been stored in current ki, the attack is quick and efficiently used
Charging up Ki - charging from reserve ki into current ki (most efficient if solely focused on the task)
Charging Attack and Ki - drawing ki from reserve ki into current energy while simultaneously charging an attack (least efficient) Final Flash


If player is charging an attack within their current power level... the energy builds with no impact and efficiently... if they are charging
a huge attack, they start burning into their reserve total ki, the effect on nature is seen (pushback) and it is massively less efficient.

1. Focus on Enemy player Transform position
2. Redirect rotation and direction of Self Player to face the x-coordinator (forward) directly at the torso of the Enemy Player
3. Create Sphere Object directly in front of the torso of Self Player, extended enough that the edge of ball is about 1 unit away
4. Charge the Ball with Power
5. Launch ball at the torso location of Enemy Player

6. If Enemy player also launches Attack Beam, redirect Self Player's attack ball to aim squarely with Enemy's attack ball
7. Engage in pushing contest based on the difference in power between both balls.
8. If either player increases the power of ball, which induces greater size, reform ball so that its radius still remains touching
   the outer shell of Enemy ball, do not simply increase size so that the smaller ball is now being eaten by bigger ball.




Currently, the balls are touching, then suddenly they shoot past each other... Two possible reasons:

Both Update() and FIxedUpdate() are running at the same time, possibly the frame per second timing is confused and one moves before the 
other one..

Or Update() is consistent enough for both balls.. perhaps FIxedUpdate is more accurate for syncing movements??
