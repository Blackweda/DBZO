Code Requirements:

Attack Beam represents sustained attacks like Final Flash or Kamehameha. 
For the initial version, the representatiin will be a sphere object trailed by a visual stream. 
All that matters is the sphere head of the beam.
The sphere will originate in front of the fighter where their arms extend (at chest/upper abdomen level). 
The act of starting a beam will angle the front body of the fighter towards the frontal chest upper abdomen of the other fighter.
Next the visual ball is created and the attack beam is targeted at the transform of the other fighter. 
The attack beam is charged and once released will lock on to the other fighter as long as they remain 
within the 30 degree frontal view of our fighter if he has maintained the camera direction after the initial lock on.


From experience in testing the code, creating Attack Spheres that are rigidbodies and moving by AddForce will NOT work. The balls, even 
when perfectly aimed at each other, will become increasingly volatile as they try to push through one another. The visual is very glitchy
loooking and eventually they fling off in random directions, out of control.

By creating balls that are character-controlled, they move very smoothly by velocity. So you will see two balls touch each other and simply
stop if their velocities are equal. One ball will move forward while the other will move backwards if one of the velocities are higher.
While this action looks very clean and controlled, it lacks the sort of volatiliity that the first version had, both in visual and in 
physics after-effects. A method to make the balls gittery while pushing each other is ideal, while maintaining the perfectness of where
they are supposed to end up.
