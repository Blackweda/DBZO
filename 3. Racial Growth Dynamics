*NOTE*

Perhaps because its possible to catch one's breath and get back energy fairly quickly, its a bad idea to have 100% of ki regen
to take place over a few hours. Perhaps ki regen can be pretty fast, but that will affect the Fatigue levels... the higher the
fatigue level, the less growth happens when those ki points regen!

*END OF NOTE*



Namekians

[ The Namekian race does not have transformations like Super Saiyan or Full Power. However, I believe that the base form growth 
rate of Namekians are on par or perhaps even greater than Saiyans. This assumption comes from the fact that Piccolo is younger 
than Goku and Vegeta, and while Goku learned Kaio-Ken for Saiyan saga and Super Saiyan for Freiza saga, Piccolo was always able 
to grow in power enough to beat those opponents a few years later, only in his base form. Piccolo was able to easily defeat 
Saibamen (Raditz power level) with incredible ease after only one year of training (rather meditating while training Gohan 
actually). He did not train at 10x gravity on King Kai's planet like Goku, nor did he have a multiplier technique to use. 
During the Android saga, Piccolo could easily defeat the Dr. Gero and Android 19 after 3 extra years of training, which took 
Vegeta and Goku fighting in Super Saiyan to beat. This means that Piccolo would have been able to defeat Frieza at this point, 
which means his base is at Goku Super Saiyan level (during Namek fight). After a certain point, Piccolo falls out of range of 
the Saiyans, only because their SSJ2 and SSJ3 power jumps are so huge, he can't keep up in base form, although I'd argue that 
Piccolo fighting GOku or Vegeta in base form would be a different story!   
With this analysis, I'm giving a favourable advantage to Namekians for growing their Ki pool, which raises their base form at a 
much faster rate than Saiyans or Herans. ]

Namekians have no plateaus for now unless we find a reason to give them one.

=========

Total Ki Regen (during combat):

  15% untrained every 3 mins        -> Only 75% can be regen of total Ki every training session or fight. Afterwards fighter 
  must stop.
  
  25% trained every 3 mins

Total Ki Regen (after combat):

  30% every 3 mins

Highest Power Level Threshold:

  70 - 77.5 % of Total Ki  <- improper designation, must change!

Total Ki Growth Algorithm (Total Ki Centric):

  For every point of Ki expended during training or meditating, it grows back at 101%.
  This means that a Namekian can power up to 20% of their total Ki and spend hours meditating and pulsing energy.
  They can use Ki regen dynamics to increase their training. Also they will not experience battle fatigue or injury.
  
  Example:
  
  A Namekian has 1,000,000 Total Ki.
  20% PowerLevel puts thems at 200,000
  
  Melee Battle Power is 200,000 / 3 mins -> 1,111 Ki / Second (without Bulking charging)
  Attack Balls = 1,111 Per Ball (without charging time)
  Attack Beam = 1,111 Per Second (without charging time)
  
  This equates to a Namekian meditating and exerting 1,111 Ki per second for 1000 seconds (16 mins), including the Ki regen 
  power, which is 15% of 1M (150,000), 5 times(max 75%) ( 5 x 150,000 = 750,000)... 750,000 /1,111, which is about another 11 
  minutes. So in 27 minutes, they have exerted all of their power. 
  
  They will regenerate in 9+ mins and have a base Ki pool of 1,010,000 (101%), but the rest period must be followed afterwards. 
  Consecutive training should be prohibited. Allow interval of [ 5 ] hours between training sessions. [ We never see Piccolo or 
  any Namekians sleeping! ]
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Saiyan
[ The Saiyan race relies heavily on Transformations (Oozaru, SSJ forms) as well as their racial ability of Zenkai boosts. While 
the Namekian's strategy will be to consume their Ki in whatever fashion, as fast and as often as possible, the Saiyans will rely 
heavily on receiving Zenkai boosts from near death battles or training that damages their body from 88% - 99%. This will happen 
if they receive attacks that overpower their battle power, wiping out their defensive ki, and directly hitting them without any 
ki defenses. The other way that they grow is from actual battles or training that offers offers resistance against their own Ki. 
The best way to describe it would be to use the analogy of weightlifting.A Namekian could stand there and flex their muscles, and 
this alone would cause them to grow stronger. The saiyan would need to actually flex his muscles because he is lifting actual 
weight. The straining of his power causes growth. Theredfore a saiyan needs to be using his ji to attack, defend against attacks, 
or be resisting the effects of gravity for example ( which is sort of liie pushing back against the ground - giving gravity a ki 
drain/second value that simulates holding back an attack beam). A percentage difference in the power level of the saiyan and the 
opposing force will be a factor in determining his growth.

Highest Power Level Threshold:

  75 - 82.5 % of Total Ki     <- improper designation, must change!

Total Ki Growth Algorithm (Balanced):

  Before we get into how Saiyans grow their base form, we must clear up a myth in Dragon Ball Z. The Super Saiyan transformation 
  is NOT a 50x multiplier like many fans think. Akira Toriyama did not intend for Super Saiyan to be a multiplier. Goku's 
  Kaio-ken was a multiplier technique, and a very volatile and body-damaging option. The Super Saiyan transformation was meant to 
  replace it with something more reliable and permanent. When Goku went Super Saiyan for the first time against Frieza, his new 
  power level at the time was 50x his base form. What this actually means is that Super Saiyan transformations are a mutation that 
  greatly increases the Ki of the fighter, thus giving them tons of extra power and ability to raise their power level. The Super Saiyan 
  transformation is a huge Ki Boost, that happened to be 50x what Goku had the first time he got the transformation. Power Level 
  stats show during Frieza fight:
  
Goku	                                3,000,000	                             Daizenshuu 7

Goku (x10 Kaioken)	                 30,000,000	                             Calculated

Goku (x20 Kaioken)	                 60,000,000	                             Calculated

Goku (Super Saiyan)	                150,000,000	                             Daizenshuu 7

As we can see, 150M = 50 x 3M... which means that the Super Saiyan transformation gave Goku about 145,000,000 extra Ki. 
Therefore, for the DBZ Online game, we will NOT treat SSJ like a multiplier, but rather a huge Ki boost. The SSJ transformations 
can be trained to give more Ki boosts over time, and the training of increasing Battle Power within SSJ form will give rise to 
Ascended Super Saiyan and Ultra Super Saiyan forms. The practice of maintaining Super Saiyan form without fighting and spending 
hours in that form will allow a Saiyan to eventually master Full Power Super Saiyan, which reduces the waste of ki energy required 
to maintain the SSJ form. The Super Saiyan form and training within it will be the most complicated pursuit of the Dragon Ball Z 
Online Game.



Therefore:  

  SSJ transformation = 145,000,000 - 245,000,000            Base: at least 2,000,000 for SSJ and plateau at about 
                                                                  9,000,000 - 10,000,000 
                                                                  
  While in base form, gains go to base form, while in SSJ form, gains go to SSJ ki boost
  INcreasing BP increases ASSJ/USSJ.... the amount of times turning SSJ and powering up slowly increases Ki Boost
  
  SSJ2 +175,000,000 - 225,000,000              245M(SSJ) + 225M(SSJ2) = 470M max
  
  Base form plateau of 10M removed and raised up to about 30 million. (max power is 500 million)
  
  SSJ3 +250,000,000 - 275,000,000              245M(SSJ) + 225M(SSJ2) + 275M(SSJ3) = 745M max
  
  Base form plateur of 30M removed and raised up to about 60 million. (max power is 805 million)
  
  At This Point, the Saiyan must learn to use Super Saiyan Blue or learn Super Saiyan 4.

Heran
[ There is little information concerning how the transformation of Herans works or how they get stronger. Therefore we can this 
opportunity to play with creating a training regiment that fits on the other spectrum of Namekian's ki-centric training style. 
So we have a race that will be BattlePower-centric. This means that Herans will have great adaptability with manipulating their 
Battle Powers (BP), and this will determine their ki growth.. for Herans, we will determine that their Full Transformation is a 
simple 3-5x multiplier of whatever Battle Power they are at. This means if they are in base form with a power level of 200,000 
they do 1.111 damage/sec. With full power, their power level increases temporarily to 600,000 now or 3,333/sec battle power. The 
full power will stack in top of any boosts. Kaioken will boost base power by 10x... But full power stacks on anything. A heran 
using kaioken x 10,will have 200,000 x 10 = 2,000,000 x 3 = 6,000,000 -> which translayes to 33,333 damage/sec.   What this also 
means is that temoorarily every point of ki is overexerting so a muktiplier in ki pool rwsults. A 3x multiplier in battle power 
gives a 3x ki pool to match. Namekiand and Saiyans do not receive ki pool multipkiers. The saiyan boosts of super saiyan gives a 
static amount of extra ki, not a multiplier. Once a heran end his fight, his body severely feels the effects like kaioken. His 
rest time is worse the bigger the boost. His ki growth is a percentage of the power he experienced in full power or some other 
boost.. So lets say his ki pool was 1,000,000. He battle powered to 200,000. His dps is 1,111/sec. He fullpowered, resulting in 
3,333 /sec and his bp is now 600,000 and his ki pool is 3,000000. Once he powers down he experienced 400,000 in extra bp. He 
experienced 2,000,000 in extra ki. Now when he regens much later, we can say he receives a percentage growth to his ki pool. The 
saiyan in a ssj transformato. Receices a huge ki pool boost, allowing them to raise their powerlevek and create a higher BP. The 
heran raises his BP, which multiplies his ki pool. Not his oowerlevel.

This means tht the saiyan can raise and kower their bp and plat willbut the heran can only choose once in a battle to FP and that 
is what they must use to fight with unless they go out of FP and raise their base form powerlrvel. This is their weakness because 
anybody sensing ki knows in general what their FP WILL BE BASED ON CURRENT BP. Herans also have the most rigid bodies. A namekian
can easily heal their own body from damages once a certain amount of Ki regens.. Saiyans and Herans have to heal over time or use
Sensu beans. While Saiyans can use techniques like Kaio-ken multipliers, Herans bodies are even more susceptible to breaking apart
from over using the technique. The trade-off just means that inherently their natural bodies can handle much more damage with 
defense ki than Saiyans or Namekians, because their bodies inherently carry enough toughness that equals about 5% of their Total
Ki.
